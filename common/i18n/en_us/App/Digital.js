    "Bitcoin is the first successful internet money based on peer-to-peer technology; whereby no central bank or authority is involved in the transaction and production of the Bitcoin currency. It was created by an anonymous individual/group under the name, Satoshi Nakamoto. The source code is available publicly as an open source project, anybody can look at it and be part of the developmental process.",
    "Bitcoin is changing the way we see money as we speak. It is a decentralized peer-to-peer internet currency making mobile payment easy, very low transaction fees, protects your identity, and it works anywhere all the time with no banking hours.",
    "As of the current design, there will only be 21 million Bitcoin ever created, thus making it a deflationary currency unlike fiat currencies. Bitcoin uses the SHA-256 hashing algorithm with an average transaction confirmation time of 10 minutes. Miners today are mining Bitcoin using ASIC chip dedicated to only mining Bitcoin, and the hash rate has shot up to peta hashes.",
    "Being the first successful online cryptography currency, Bitcoin has inspired other alternative currencies such as Litecoin, Peercoin, Primecoin, and so on."

    "At its simplest, Ethereum is an open software platform based on blockchain technology that enables developers to build and deploy decentralized applications.",
    "Ethereum is a distributed public blockchain network. Although there are some significant technical differences between the two, the most important distinction to note is that Bitcoin and Ethereum differ substantially in purpose and capability. the Ethereum blockchain focuses on running the programming code of any decentralized application.",
    "In the Ethereum blockchain, instead of mining for bitcoin, miners work to earn Ether, a type of crypto token that fuels the network. Beyond a tradeable cryptocurrency, Ether is also used by application developers to pay for transaction fees and services on the Ethereum network."

    "Metaverse is an open-source public blockchain that aims to provide digital assets and digital identities. Through Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS), we make convenient, secure digital financial services accessible to all Internet applications at virtually no cost.",
    "Founded in 2016, Metaverse went live in February of 2017. We strongly believe that blockchain technology is the catalyst for a better future - the New Reality.Founded in 2016, Metaverse went live in February of 2017.

    "As a decentralized platform in the Web4.0 era, Tron can be used in various complex scenarios to support the application of a large number of users. We will build a complete ecosystem based on Tron.",
    "TRON is an ambitious project dedicated to building the infrastructure for a truly decentralized Internet. The Tron Protocol, one of the largest blockchain based operating systems in the world, offers scalable, high-availability and high-throughput support that underlies all the decentralized applications in the TRON ecosystem",
    "• Users can reduce costs, improve convenience of life and gain fortune by using various dAPPs deployed in TRON.",
    "• Developers has a startlingly vast range of rights, including deploying dApp on TRON net, expanding business and carrying forward their own belief and value. ",
    "• Network witness outlines support for TRON and gains abundant returns. ",
    "Everyone will devote their energy to the construction and prosperity of TRON ecosystem and be rewarded from it, regardless of users, developers or TRON network witnesses. "
